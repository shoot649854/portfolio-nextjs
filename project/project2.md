### Description

This article summarizes the project conducted in Nagoya, Japan, in the summer of 2023 jointly with Metele. In this article, along with my subjective views, I summarize how our team narrowed down ideas and worked on creating a mobile application over three days.

### Ideathon / Brainstorming

Our group decided to start by thinking from the themes given to us. Our theme was mobility and big data transportation. The fact that Toyota Motor Corporation was the sponsor was a major factor behind these three themes. However, these three themes presented complexities that other teams did not face, and it was very difficult for us to decide what ideas to ultimately pursue. We were free to choose the background and era for the product we were going to create.

### Our Solution

We decided to focus on Japan 30 years from now or a depopulated Japan. In the summer of 2023, as the aging population continues to decline, it is predicted that depopulation in rural areas will increase as more people move to major cities. Japan is also known for its volcanic zones and is prone to earthquakes, so we considered that in 30 years, as more people move to major cities, there may be an environment where they cannot return to corrupt rural areas. Among our team members, there were many who grew up in rural areas but moved to Tokyo for university or work, or friends who went abroad. Such people often express a desire to return to their hometowns at milestones, so there are quite a few friends who return to rural areas. Therefore, we created a mobile application to display 3D models.

### Struggle

One of the challenges we faced was that many of our team members had little development experience. This project was more targeted towards beginners or students with various interests rather than those with prior experience, so it was not originally screened based on experience, and it was a project aimed at a wide range of experiences. Therefore, there was a lot of teaching from ourselves. For example, we taught as much as possible over the three days, such as how to use GitHub and basic coding methods.

### Demo

Therefore, we engineers decided to develop a demo as a mobile application and started creating it with five engineers in Japan. The difficult part was using Google Maps API and Luma API with Flutter.

### Conclusion

The good thing about this project was that Toyota Motor Corporation was a sponsor, which gave us, students, the opportunity to have industry professionals evaluate our ideas and products. Also, the evaluations were generally positive despite the short time we spent on the product. Regarding this, I think there were many points where the ideas could have been further scrutinized, but I feel that we fought as much as possible against an interesting company like Toyota.
