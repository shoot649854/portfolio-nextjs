### What is ANTI SOCIETY?

Hello, I am the representative of ANTI SOCIETY. This time, I wowed the audience with my presentation and the fact that I came from California, but when I started working on the project, I was a bit of a toppin' pooh-pooh. First of all, we decided to make it in Flutter, and it took about 12 hours to set up the environment ((I developed an allergy to Flutter)). Then I had to finish it in about 4 hours, so it may have turned out poorly, but as an idea, and for a student with so little development experience... I'm not sure if it was a good idea or not... ðŸ™‡ ... So thank you for looking at Qiita. I hope you will also check out the Github page as well.

### Raising Issues

The current health care system has a serious problem: physicians are burdened with excessive paperwork and the need to fill out extensive medical records. A significant portion of their time is spent on this administrative task, resulting in limited opportunities for direct patient care. As a result, the quality of patient care suffers and health care professionals struggle to communicate and collaborate effectively with one another. Inefficient physician time utilization hinders their ability to provide optimal health care services, reduces patient satisfaction, and can impair patient outcomes. Solutions are needed to streamline administrative tasks, allow physicians to focus more on patient care, and facilitate better communication within the healthcare ecosystem.

### Our Solution

We therefore propose the implementation of a visual verification system as a solution. The goal of this approach is to reduce paperwork and streamline processes, allowing physicians to allocate more time to direct patient care. The use of visual technology, including automation and digitization, simplifies administrative tasks, improves efficiency, and facilitates communication among healthcare professionals.

### Output

Plan:
1. Gather information: Collect information about the patient's medical history, current symptoms, and lifestyle.
2. Assess: Assess the patient's physical and mental health, including any existing conditions or medications.
3. Diagnose: Diagnose the patient's condition based on the information gathered and the assessment.
4. Develop a treatment plan: Develop a treatment plan that is tailored to the patient's individual needs and goals.
5. Monitor progress: Monitor the patient's progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.
