# üöÄ What is README.md? 
README is the application's

- Overview
- Environment setup

and other information necessary for the project.
In this article, I will explain how to write an easy-to-understand README that can be found on GitHub and other sites.


# ü§î Purpose of README.md
When a new member joins a project, writing a README with an overview of the project and links to necessary documents will make it easier to understand the project and reduce unnecessary communication costs. Also, by writing the procedures for building the environment, anyone can build the development environment without relying on the technical level of each individual.

# üóíÔ∏è Content list

- Directory structure
- How to build a development environment
- Troubleshooting

## Main Technologies In Use

I put "Sheild" at the beginning of the file because I felt it would be difficult for someone who is not familiar with the technology used in the project to see it.
