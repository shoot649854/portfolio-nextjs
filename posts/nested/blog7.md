# 5 things you shouldn't do at hackathon and startup

Good UI: Don't focus on the look, focus on the idea.
Whether you want to start a project or start a business, the underlying idea is very important. If you don't have a clear idea of what you want to do, it often doesn't come across even when it's designed, so the idea should be discussed properly no matter what, to create something everyone can agree on.
No ACTUAL conversation: Talk properly!
Don't be afraid to talk. Don't be afraid to talk, and don't compromise. If you want to start something, you should discuss it properly, and if there are people around you whom you would respect if you were to go to them, you should take their opinions and make it better. So in any case you have to speak up and you have to incorporate your own ideas to make something good.
Trying out something new, using niche tech: Stop it, other team members are in trouble. Shouldn't add to the experience.
If it's not something that everyone can share, it's very weak to use. If there is a reason for using a technology or passage, fine, but if there is no reason, etc. for a technology or little-known tool that no one has used before, don't do it. Try it out on your own, and if it's easy to use, try it for a group project.
Not very much domain power/knowledge: You don't have to have it, but it would be a huge help.
It is very important to have someone who is knowledgeable in the area, especially if you are doing a project or a company. Secondly, you gain knowledge. Knowledge is not something that can be easily found by Googling, but something that only someone who has done research and is knowledgeable in the area would know about. That's reassuring.
Not networking: What are you doing here?
This is true for projects and when meeting various people, but if you don't take it into consideration, it is hard to understand what you are doing here. If you are shy or don't communicate yourself here, you can't be a big person.
