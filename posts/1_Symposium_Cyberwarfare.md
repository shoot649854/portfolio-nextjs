title: Symposium Cyberwarfare in Russia and Ukraine
description: Recently, I worked on a school project about the cyberwarfare between Russia and Ukraine. I conducted research on what is happening and how much damage has occurred, as well as what types of cyber attacks have been used. For my research, I primarily referenced a cyber report from Microsoft, as well as cybersecurity conferences like DEF CON and BlackHat.
