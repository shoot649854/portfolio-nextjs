## Internship1


### Software Engineering at Tsubasa

Started in the summer of 2023 at a Japanese startup. Initial tasks involved creating a Running web application for user health. Explored the library for efficient demo development. Later, focused on front-end development, delving into AWS Cognito for user authentication. Acquired valuable experience in project initiation, client communication, and project completion.

### Introduction

My internship in Japan began in the summer of 2023. I had an internship at a start-up company, and what I was able to absorb was very significant. I don't think I can go into detail in this article due to the nature of my duties, but I will try to write as much as I can.

### First Task

The first task I was assigned was to create a simple demonstration in Python. I was given this task because it is very easy to create an application, and because there is an ibrary that makes it possible to create a demonstration without having to start in earnest using react and the like. The project our team was assigned was an app that would draw user health information, so a major point of contention was how much potential we could show in a demonstration state.

### Frontend Task

Next to the demonstration, we were assigned the task of creating the front end. I had never done any front-end development before, so I was at a bit of a loss as to how to start and what the rules were, but I studied every day and learned a lot. One of the things I learned a lot about was the authentication using AWS cognitives. I learned a lot from the page where each user is given a password and username to sign in while protecting their personal information. It was also good to have practical experience of how a project starts, how to talk to clients, and how to finish the project.

### Developing Responsive Mapbox Feature

We were able to receive real-time Chilean information on where the athletes were, so we were able to display that geographic information on a map. The difficult part was that we had envisioned a UI like Google Maps, but due to funding, we had to use other maps, so we had to think thoroughly about how to display the information in a way that would be easy for users to understand. Also, since a map is like a collection of dots, zooming in and out causes optimizations, so we had to think about how to speed up the process.
