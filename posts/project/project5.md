## Internship

### Software Engineering Internship at Tsubasa

I began my internship in the summer of 2023 at a Japanese startup called Tsubasa. Initially, my tasks involved creating a Running web application focused on user health. I explored libraries for efficient demo development and later shifted my focus to front-end development. In this role, I delved into AWS Cognito for user authentication. Throughout this experience, I gained valuable insights into project initiation, client communication, and project completion.

### Introduction

My internship in Japan commenced in the summer of 2023, where I worked at a start-up company called Tsubasa. The experience was highly enriching, although I cannot delve into specific details due to the nature of my responsibilities.

### First Task

My initial assignment was to create a simple demonstration using Python. This task was assigned because of its simplicity in application development, aided by available libraries. Our team's project focused on developing an app to track user health data, and we aimed to showcase its potential in the demonstration.

### Frontend Task

Following the demonstration, we were tasked with developing the front end. As someone with no prior experience in front-end development, I faced challenges in understanding where to begin and what guidelines to follow. However, through daily study and practice, I acquired valuable knowledge. One area I delved into was authentication using AWS Cognito, learning how to manage user login credentials securely. Additionally, I gained practical experience in project initiation, client interaction, and project delivery.

### Developing Responsive Mapbox Feature

One of our significant achievements was integrating real-time Chilean athlete data into our application and displaying it on a map. We initially envisioned a UI similar to Google Maps but had to adapt due to budget constraints. This required careful consideration to ensure the information was presented in a user-friendly manner. Additionally, optimizing the map for zooming in and out posed challenges, requiring us to devise strategies to enhance performance.
