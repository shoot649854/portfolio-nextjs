# Motivation
As for my motivation for this internship, my strength is that I can do machine learning and data science in this internship, as my previous internship was focused on web application development. Since I had studied machine learning in computer science and research at my university, I wanted to experience what it is like in the real world, not just in web applications, but in a wide range of machine learning and other areas as well. The last internship was more front-end oriented, whereas this internship will be back-end work.
