# Commonly Used React Hooks

Here's a list of some commonly used React hooks along with brief explanations:

## useState

Allows functional components to manage state.

## useEffect

Allows functional components to perform side effects (e.g., data fetching, DOM manipulation) after render.

## useContext

Allows functional components to consume context.

## useReducer

An alternative to useState. Allows functional components to manage complex state logic with reducers.

## useCallback

Memoizes callback functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

## useMemo

Memoizes computed values to prevent unnecessary recalculations.

## useRef

Provides a mutable reference that persists across renders.

## useLayoutEffect

Similar to useEffect, but fires synchronously after all DOM mutations.

## useImperativeHandle

Customizes the instance value that is exposed to parent components when using ref.

## useDebugValue

Adds a label to custom hooks for better debugging in React DevTools.
