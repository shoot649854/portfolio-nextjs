# Motivation
As for my motivation for this internship, my strength is that I can do machine learning and data science in this internship, as my previous internship was focused on web application development. Since I had studied machine learning in computer science and research at my university, I wanted to experience what it is like in the real world, not just in web applications, but in a wide range of machine learning and other areas as well. The last internship was more front-end oriented, whereas this internship will be back-end work.

As a member of the AI Research Institute, my role primarily focused on contributing to the development of articles related to artificial intelligence. Specifically, I worked on generating content aimed at raising awareness about Azure and other technology corporations in Japan. The goal was to highlight Azure's capabilities and advantages, especially in comparison to other cloud service providers like AWS, to ensure a broader understanding and adoption of Azure within the Japanese market.
